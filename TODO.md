### TODO
* Seperate login/register into their own pages
    * Double password field to ensure correct password
    * Remove name on login page 
    * Choose membership length on registration - interesting bit of business logic for you to work on. How will this be stored in the database?

* Research protected routes on react router. https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/example/auth-workflow
